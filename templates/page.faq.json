            "text": "<p>Divine Vintage is an eclectic, highly-curated Wine, Vintage Clothing and Jewelry shop from Jennifer Rush of Blue Plate Restaurant Group.<\/p><p>The new shop is a return to Montana Avenue for Jen and an extension of her lifelong passions; wine, collecting vintage, and appreciation of fine quality and craftsmanship. She was the founder of the original Blue Plate, as well as the legendary Divine Pasta, both Santa Monica staples. The new store is nestled beside Kreation Cafe in a beautiful classic bungalow, brought to life with help from Argyle Design. In what can only be described as “granny-chic”, green Gucci-wallpaper in the bathrooms meets merlot-colored cabinets and a 4ft ship-shaped crystal chandelier. The space is a treasure chest - a perfect setting for finding beautiful objects with a story.<\/p><p>Divine Vintage is a declaration to Nick Dumergue’s love of wine; utilizing his vast knowledge of wine from years of judging and tasting for Decanter magazine and buying wine for Harrod’s and private collectors, the shop’s wines reflect only the best of the best of each category and every price point. Most of the wines are organic and naturally produced, with an emphasis on exceptional producers, unusual finds, craveable everyday values and special wines for the most important celebrations. A monthly wine-club will ship you Nick’s selection for the month; his goal is to foster a love of wine by broadening your wine-drinking horizons.<\/p><p>Early 2023 will welcome Jenny and Nick’s other passion - education. A slew of classes, community events, tastings, and bottle releases will light up Montana Ave. The shop is open 11am to 7pm daily. Most of the inventory will be available on the website, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.divinevintage.com\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">www.divinevintage.com<\/span><\/a> but all the latest and greatest is available in-shop only.<\/p><p>--<\/p><p>Jen Rush was in New York City and brought up in San Diego, California, Jen’s earliest memories are flea-market treasure hunting with her grandma. She graduated from UCLA in 1987 with a degree in industrial design, eventually opening the Blue Plate restaurants. A Santa Monica local of 25 years, Jenny has two children and two rescue dogs.<\/p><p>Nick Dumergue started his career in 1990 as a sommelier in his native New Zealand and went on to helm wine programs all over the world, from Harrod’s in London to super-yachts in the Mediterranean and most currently, with Gordon Ramsay to produce his signature Californian wine. He has made wine in ten countries, is a certified Diploma Educator for the WSET, current Senior Judge at the International Wine Challenge. Nick continues to taste thousands of wines from all over the world every year and currently consults on private labeling wine, restaurant wine programs, and curated wine boot camps in France, Italy and Australia. The rest of the time, Nick can be found surfing, shucking oysters and traveling.<\/p>",
